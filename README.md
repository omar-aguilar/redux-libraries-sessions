Basic redux examples and integration with thunk and sagas

## Prerequisites

* Node 12 or above (recommended v16.14.0)

Just install libraries `npm i`

## Run an example
To run an example you need to use the `npm run exec` script, to run the example 1 (counter reducer) you need to type:

Happy Coding :D
